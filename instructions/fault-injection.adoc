= Fault Injection
include::_attributes.adoc[]

Apply some chaos engineering by throwing in some HTTP errors or network
delays. Understanding failure scenarios is a critical aspect of microservices
architecture (aka distributed computing).

== What we will learn in this module
This module will provide instruction on how to introduce service failures and
delays to better understand, test, and design microservices.

[IMPORTANT]
.Before Start
====
You should have only the following virtualservices and destinationrules in
the `istio-tutorial` namespace:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role="copypaste"]
----
oc -n istio-tutorial get destinationrule
oc -n istio-tutorial get virtualservice
----

And you should see something like the following:

----
No resources found.

NAME       GATEWAYS             HOSTS   AGE
customer   [customer-gateway]   [*]     18h
----
====

[#503error]
== HTTP Error 503

By default, recommendation v1, v2 and v3 are being randomly load-balanced as
that is the default behavior in Service Mesh.

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role="copypaste"]
----
oc -n istio-tutorial get pods -l app=recommendation
----

You will see something like:

----
NAME                                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
recommendation-v1-7fbb8f794-ngw58    2/2     Running   0          21h
recommendation-v2-77bc7bb94d-8wjxz   2/2     Running   0          17h
recommendation-v3-5786cd744d-96q79   2/2     Running   0          17h
----

Then, execute:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role="copypaste"]
----
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoraxe/istio-lab-summit-2019/master/scripts/curl_customer.sh)
----

You will see something like:

----
customer => preference => recommendation v1 from '7f8755bb79-vjwq2': 26
customer => preference => recommendation v2 from '74f48f4cbc-j7rfm': 27
customer => preference => recommendation v3 from '588747fd55-m8mj9': 27
customer => preference => recommendation v1 from '7f8755bb79-vjwq2': 27
customer => preference => recommendation v2 from '74f48f4cbc-j7rfm': 28
customer => preference => recommendation v3 from '588747fd55-m8mj9': 28
customer => preference => recommendation v1 from '7f8755bb79-vjwq2': 28
----

You can inject 503's, for approximately 50% of the requests. To see how this is done,
take a look at link:http://github.com/thoraxe/istio-lab-summit-2019/blob/master/src/istiofiles/virtual-service-recommendation-503.yml[virtual-service-recommendation-503.yml]

[source,yaml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: recommendation
spec:
  host: recommendation
  subsets:
  - labels:
      version: v1
    name: v1
  - labels:
      version: v2
    name: v2
  - labels:
      version: v3
    name: v3
---
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: recommendation
spec:
  hosts:
  - recommendation
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: recommendation
        subset: v1
      weight: 34
    - destination:
        host: recommendation
        subset: v2
      weight: 33
    - destination:
        host: recommendation
        subset: v3
      weight: 33
    fault:
      abort:
        percentage:
          value: 50
        httpStatus: 503
---
----

Note that this file creates 2 resources. First, a DestinationRule
`recommendation` with subsets for v1, v2, and v3. Second, a VirtualService
`recommendation` that splits traffic equally between v1, v2, and v3 but also
introduces a 503 fault for 50% of the requests.

[NOTE]
====
You may not see the 503 failures at 50% from the client due to the
retry behavior in the lab ServiceMesh environment. When the preference ->
recommendation call fails it will be retried 3x. Thus there is a high
probability that the client will not see a failure but you will see that the
failure rate is accurately reflected in the Kiali console.

and then choose:

* Namespace: istio-tutorial
* Versioned app graph
* Requests percentage
* Last 1m
* Every 10s

Note the 50% failure rate from preference to recommendation.

=== Clean up

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role="copypaste"]
----
oc -n istio-tutorial delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoraxe/istio-lab-summit-2019/master/src/istiofiles/virtual-service-recommendation-503.yml

[#delay]
== Delay

The most insidious of possible distributed computing faults is not a "down"
service but a service that is responding slowly, potentially causing a
cascading failure in your network of services. To see how to inject such a
delay, take a look at
link:http://github.com/thoraxe/istio-lab-summit-2019/blob/master/src/istiofiles/virtual-service-recommendation-delay.yml[virtual-service-recommendation-delay.yml]

---
----

Note that this file creates 2 resources. First, a DestinationRule
`recommendation` with subsets for v1, v2, and v3. Second, a VirtualService
`recommendation` that splits traffic equally between v1, v2, and v3 but also
introduces a 7s delay for 50% of the requests.


[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role="copypaste"]
----
oc -n istio-tutorial create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoraxe/istio-lab-summit-2019/master/src/istiofiles/virtual-service-recommendation-delay.yml
----

You will see something like:

----
destinationrule.networking.istio.io/recommendation created
virtualservice.networking.istio.io/recommendation created
----

And hit the customer endpoint:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role="copypaste"]
----
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoraxe/istio-lab-summit-2019/master/scripts/curl_customer.sh)
----

You will notice many requests to the customer endpoint now have a delay. If
you are monitoring the logs for recommendation v1, v2 and v3, you will also
see the delay happens BEFORE the recommendation service is actually called.

//TODO: switch to automated command
[NOTE]
====
Use `oc get pods -n istio-tutorial` to find the `recommendation` pods to look at the logs.
====

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role="copypaste copypaste-warning"]
----
oc -n istio-tutorial logs -f recommendation-v#-XXXXXXXXXXXX -c recommendation
----

You will see something like:

----
Apr 26, 2019 9:31:09 PM com.redhat.developer.demos.recommendation.rest.RecommendationResource getRecommendations
INFO: recommendation request from 7fbb8f794-ngw58: 8334

=== Kiali's Distributed Tracing

Within the Kiali UI select the *Distributed Tracing* option from the left
hand navigation and then choose:

* Namespace: istio-tutorial
* Service: recommendation.istio-tutorial

and finally press the *Search* button.

[#img-503]
.Kiali Graph Showing Delays
image::delay.png[]

Note that 50% of the traces are slightly over the artificial 7s delay while
the other 50% are in the low ms range.

----
oc -n istio-tutorial delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoraxe/istio-lab-summit-2019/master/src/istiofiles/virtual-service-recommendation-delay.yml

== What we learned in this module
ServiceMesh provides a simple mechanism to simulate service and network
failures and delays to improve microservice testing and resiliency. Kiali
provides a rich console to visualize the service failure rates and service
delays.
