= Mutual TLS

Apply Mutual TLS to services in the cluster. 

:toc:

== What we will learn in this module
This module will provide instruction on how to enable Mutual TLS to secure communication
 between services in the mesh.

[IMPORTANT]
.Before you start
====

You should only have the following virtual services and destination rules in the istio-tutorial namespace

[source,bash]
----
oc -n istio-tutorial get destinationrule
No resources found.

oc -n istio-tutorial get virtualservices
NAME       GATEWAYS             HOSTS     AGE
customer   [customer-gateway]   [*]       4d2h

[#enablemtls]
== Enabling Mutual TLS
For this example, we will take advantage of another pod that is outside of the service mesh. Let's grab that and the customer pod in a variable.


Examine the traffic between the curl and customer services and the preference service.

_Kialiâ€™s Graph_

Within the Kiali UI select the Graph option from the left hand navigation and then choose
* Namespace: istio-tutorial
* Versioned app graph
* Requests percentage
* Last 1m
* Every 10s
* Security checked under display

Notice that both requests were successful. In the Kiali graph, this can be seen from the green line.

Now configure preference to use mutual TLS policy. 

[source,bash]
----
oc -n istio-tutorial create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoraxe/istio-lab-summit-2019/master/src/istiofiles/authentication-enable-tls.yml
----

The Policy just created can be seen below:

[source, yaml]
----

And try the curl again.

----

This time, we can see that the curl failed with exit code 56. This is because
 preference is now requiring encrypted communication over  mutual TLS, but neither customer nor curl are using it.

We can see the same thing in Kiali. 

image::mtls_no_destination_rule.png[]

Now create a destination rule to make communication to customer use mutual TLS and run the curl again.

----

This time, we can see that because customer is part of the mesh, the request is successful. Since preference isn't, that still fails. 

Looking at the Kiali graph, a lock is now present for communicationbetween customer and preference, indicating that this communication is secured via mTLS.

[#mtlsmigration]
== mTLS migration

Mutual TLS in OpenShift Service Mesh provides the ability to migrate to mTLS gradually rather than forcing all services to migrate to mTLS at once. Lets try that now. 

First, delete the policy we created above.

[source,bash]
----
oc delete policy -n istio-tutorial preference-mutualtls
----

Now create a policy using permissive mode. 

[source,bash]
----
oc -n istio-tutorial create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoraxe/istio-lab-summit-2019/master/src/istiofiles/policy-permissive-tls.yml
----

The contents of the file are displayed below.
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "authentication.istio.io/v1alpha1"

  name: "preference-mutualtls"
  namespace: istio-tutorial
spec:
  targets:
  - name: preference
  peers:
  - mtls: 
      mode: PERMISSIVE
----

If we try our curl commands again, we notice that this time they both pass.

In Kiali, we can see that the lock is still shown, indicating the presence of mTLS. We see the curl pod labeled as unknown since it's not part of the mesh, and we can see that both customer and curl are succesful.
