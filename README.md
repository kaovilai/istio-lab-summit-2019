# Red Hat Summit 2019: 
# Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh in Action

## Purpose

As microservices-based applications become more prevalent, both the number of
and complexity of their interactions increases. Up until now much of the burden
of managing these complex microservices interactions has been placed on the
application developer, with different or non-existent support for microservice
concepts depending on language and framework.

The service mesh concept pushes this responsibility to the infrastructure, with
features for traffic management, distributed tracing and observability, policy
enforcement, and service/identity security, freeing the developer to focus on
business value. In this hands-on session you will learn how to apply some of
these features to a simple polyglot microservices application running on top of
OpenShift using Istio, an open platform to connect, manage, and secure
microservices.

## Background

Istio is an open platform to connect, manage, and secure microservices. Istio
provides an easy way to create a network of deployed services with load
balancing, service-to-service authentication, monitoring, and more, without
requiring any changes in application code. OpenShift can automatically inject a
special sidecar proxy throughout your environment to enable Istio management for
your application. This proxy intercepts all network communication between your
microservices microservices, and is configured and managed using Istioâ€™s control
plane functionality -- not your application code!

Kiali is an observability console designed to provide operational insight
into the behavior and performance of the service mesh as a whole.

Jaeger is a utility for capturing distributed tracing information of requests
as they travel throughout the mesh.

Prometheus and Grafana are used to capture metrics about the performance and
behavior of the mesh.

These components combined together are the Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh.


# Using this lab content elsewhere
## Deploy On OpenShift

You can deploy the lab guides as a container image anywhere but most
conveniently, you can deploy it on OpenShift Online or other OpenShift flavours:

```
oc new-project guides
oc new-app osevg/workshopper --name=istio-workshop \
      -e CONTENT_URL_PREFIX=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jamesfalkner/istio-lab-summit-2018/master/instructions
      -e WORKSHOPS_URLS="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jamesfalkner/istio-lab-summit-2018/master/instructions/_rhsummit18.yml" \
      -e JAVA_APP=false \
      -e OPENSHIFT_MASTER="http://127.0.0.1:8443" \
      -e APPS_SUFFIX="apps.127.0.0.1.nip.io" \
      -e ISTIO_LAB_HOSTNAME="127.0.0.1"

oc expose svc/istio-workshop
```

Replace `OPENSHIFT_MASTER` with the URL to the console of your working OpenShift
environment (e.g.  `http://128.0.0.1:8443`), `APPS_SUFFIX` with your default
routing suffix (e.g.  `apps.127.0.0.1.nip.io`), and `ISTIO_LAB_HOSTNAME` with
the public hostname of your machine. These variables are used to subsitute
values in the markdown content files.

The guides can then be accessed at `http://istio-workshop-guides.$APPS_SUFFIX`.

The lab content (`.md` files) will be pulled from the GitHub when users access the guides in
their browser.

Note that the workshop variables can be overriden via specifying environment
variables on the container itself e.g. the `JAVA_APP` env var in the above
command

## Test Locally with Docker

You can directly run Workshopper as a docker container which is specially helpful when writing the content.
```
docker run -p 8080:8080 -v $(pwd):/app-data \
              -e CONTENT_URL_PREFIX="file:///app-data/instructions" \
              -e WORKSHOPS_URLS="file:///app-data/instructions/_rhsummit18.yml" \
              -e OPENSHIFT_MASTER="foo" \
              -e APPS_SUFFIX="$MY_IP.xip.io" \
              -e ISTIO_LAB_HOSTNAME="MY_HOSTNAME" \
              osevg/workshopper:latest
```

Replace `OPENSHIFT_MASTER` with the URL to the console of your working OpenShift
environment (e.g.  `http://128.0.0.1:8443`), `APPS_SUFFIX` with your default
routing suffix (e.g.  `apps.127.0.0.1.nip.io`), and `ISTIO_LAB_HOSTNAME` with
the public hostname of your machine. These variables are used to subsitute
values in the markdown content files.

Go to `http://localhost:8080` on your browser to see the rendered workshop
content. You can modify the lab instructions and refresh the page to see the
latest changes.
